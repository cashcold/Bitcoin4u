                    <h1><span>TYPES</span> OF <span>DIGITAL</span> & CRYPTOCURRENCIES</h1>
                    <p>Encrypted coins and tokens can fall under the heading of crypto. And, generally, they can be listed into two sorts of cryptocurrency: alternative cryptocurrency coins (Altcoins) or tokens.</p>
                    <p>
                    <h1><span>Alternative</span> Cryptocurrency <span>Coins</span> (Altcoins)</h1>
                    Altcoins usually refer to any coins that are not Bitcoins. Bitcoin is a popular digital currency that’s produced by computational solutions to complicated math problems. It works separately from a central bank or state entity (i.e., government-backed Treasury).ome altcoins include:
                    <br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Peercoin</span></li>
                        <li><span>Litecoin</span></li>
                        <li><span> Dogecoin</span></li>
                        <li><span>Auroracoin</span></li>
                        <li><span>Namecoin</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In fact, the name “altcoin” actually means “alternative to Bitcoin.” Namecoin is considered the very first altcoin, created in 2011.
                    </p>

                    Like Bitcoin, most cryptocurrencies listed here have a limited supply of coins—to keep the balance in check and to reinforce its perceived value. There is a fixed number of Bitcoins that can exist—21 million, as decided by the creator/s of Bitcoin, though some remain to be mined. Once all 21 million are tapped (the number changes when new blocks are mined), that’s it. The only way to bring in more is for Bitcoin’s protocol to allow for it.

                    Though most altcoins are built upon the same basic framework as <span>Bitcoin</span>, many claim to be better versions of Bitcoin. Each system can differ from the ne
                    </p>
                    <p>Some coins don’t work with the same open-source protocol that Bitcoin does, however. For example, the following list of cryptocurrencies have created their own separate systems and protocols:</p>
                  
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Ethereum</span></li>
                        <li><span>Ripple</span></li>
                        <li><span>Omni</span></li>
                        <li><span> Nxt</span></li>
                        <li><span>Waves</span></li>
                        <li><span>Counterparty</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h6>They’re each <span>self-supporting,</span> too.</h6>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h1><span>Tokens</span></h1>
                        Unlike altcoins, tokens are created and given out through an Initial Coin Offering, or ICO, very much like a stock offering. They can be represented as:
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <ul>
                        <li><span>Value tokens (Bitcoins)</span></li>
                        <li><span>Security tokens (to protect your account)</span></li>
                        <li><span> Utility tokens (designated for specific uses)</span></li>
                        <br/>
                        They are not so much meant to be used as money as they are used to describe a function. Like American dollars, they represent value but they are not in themselves of value. Tokens are a type of encryption, specifically referring to the long lines of numbers and letters representing the crypto used in a transaction, such as a money transfer or bill payment. In short, tokens cover a number of meanings.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        For instance, both <span>Bitcoin</span> and <span>Ether</span> (from Ethereum) are considered crypto tokens.
                        
                    </ul>
                    </p>
